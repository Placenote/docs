# Introduction to the Tutorials section
The tutorials in this section are designed to help you learn Placenote SDK through step-by-step guided coding sessions, that gradually increase in complexity. At the end of this section you will be able to quickly build and deploy Placenote apps from scratch. Each tutorial will have a corresponding sample project repository that you can download and follow along with the tutorials.

!!! tip
    The *PlacenoteSDKExample* sample app we compiled [in the previous section](../build-sample-app.md) is a comprehensive sample app that implements most Placenote functionality. If you wish, you can skip the tutorials and modify this sample app but we recommend following these tutorials to help you gain a better understanding of how Placenote works and what you can do with it.
