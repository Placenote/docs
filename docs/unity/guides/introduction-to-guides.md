# Introduction to the Guides section
The guides in this section are designed to help you learn Placenote SDK through step by step tutorials, with increasing complexity. At the end of this section you will be able to quickly build and deploy Placenote apps from scratch. Each guide will be associated with a sample project in the Placenote UnityPackage.

!!! tip
    The *RandomShapes* sample app we compiled [in the previous section](../build-sample-app.md) is a comprehensive sample app that implements most Placenote functionality. If you wish to skip the guides, feel free to use this app as a starting point for your Unity projects. We recommend following these guides to help you gain a much better understanding of what you can do with Placenote SDK.
